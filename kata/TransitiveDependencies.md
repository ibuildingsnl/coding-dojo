# Transitive Dependencies

## Kata

Write a system that accepts a node and its direct dependencies from a CSV:
    
    A,B,C
    B,C,E,K
    
... and so on.
    
Using the given dataset, try to:

 1. calculate a list of each node's transitive dependencies using the
    given datasets;
 2. answer whether a node is a transitive dependencies of another node.

## Extra challenges

When you feel you have the time, think about how your code will perform
time-wise and memory-wise. How does your system scale?
